# predicting-bike-sharing

As a part of this hands on project for the Udacity nanodegree course, I built my first neural network to predict daily bike ridership.

Building a neural network from scratch covers concepts such as gradient descent, backpropagation. 

Dataset for this project can be imported from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Database).
